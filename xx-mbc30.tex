\chapter{MBC30 mapper chip}

MBC30 is a variant of MBC3 used by Japanese Pokemon Crystal to support a larger
RAM chip. Featurewise MBC30 is almost identical to MBC3, but supports RAM sizes
up to 512 Kbit (8 banks of \hex{2000} bytes). Information in this section is
based on my MBC30 research.

\begin{warning}
  The circuit board of Japanese Pokemon Crystal includes a 1 Mbit RAM chip, but
  MBC30 is limited to 512 Kbit RAM. One of the RAM address pins is unused, so
  half of the RAM is wasted and is inaccessible without modifications. So, the
  game only uses 512 Kbit and there is a mismatch between accessible and the
  physical amounts of RAM.
\end{warning}
